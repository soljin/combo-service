Combo JS & CSS
--------------

This app is designed to work with express. Either on it's own or as a dependency that can be passed a express instance.

If run as a stand alone service you can configure the app via config.json.

If running as a dependency you can pass in similar params as an object. Like this:

    var express = require("express);
        combo = require("combo-js-css");
        app = express();
    
    combo.bindComboService(app, {
        /* These can be configured per request with qquery params */
        "dev": false,
        "cacheTimeOut": 5, 
        "compressJS": true,
        "compressCSS": true,
        
        /* These are set once configs that define the routing */
        "port":8080,
        "baseComboPath":"/combo",
        "jsComboPath":"/js/",
        "cssComboPath":"/css/",
        
        /* 
        *  For every path recieved on either the js or css combo the service
        *  will look in the these paths for a match before giving up.
        *  This is the most crucial configuration.
        */
        "pathSets":[
            
            {
                "rootPath":"/www",
                "cssRootPath":"/css/",
                "jsRootPath":"/js/"
            },
            {
                "rootPath":"/data/static",
                "cssRootPath":"/css/",
                "jsRootPath":"/js/"
            }
        ]
    });
